# Roadmap

Calendar targets after the initial release depend on that release. If it slips, the new
date is recorded here and every dependent milestone is rescheduled prospectively; nothing is
backdated. Year 1 runs October 2026 through September 2027.

| Milestone | Target | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| Public comment on personalized-pricing evidence | September 2026 | Technical comment to the Federal Trade Commission's proposed Enforcement Policy Statement on Personalized Pricing (docket FTC-2026-1057) describing how input allowlists, input-access logs, decision records, and release records make the contemplated disclosures verifiable; publish the regulatory evidence map with the release |
| Initial public release (package 0.1.x; specification 0.1.3) | Within 60 days of the response | Prepare candidate 0.1.5 under `ai-workflows/ai-decision-reliability/` in `BichengWang/ai-decision-system`; complete module and rights review; include the cleared license text and metadata before freeze; freeze source commit M and project tree T; export standalone commit E with root tree T; reproduce E on a qualifying clean machine/account; record maintainer acceptance; publish that same E on `relia-release` with an annotated `relia/v<version>` tag; include the technical report, NIST AI RMF crosswalk, and regulatory evidence map; retain source/export, bundle, tag, result, and manifest identities externally |
| Post-release validation | Q4 2026 | Portability run on a second operating system or processor architecture under per-metric tolerances fixed before the run; record setup/run time, peak memory and disk, and the hardware envelope the measurements support; ~~extend the input guard to the ranking path~~ (done 2026-10-01, PR #176: ranking features are built through the guard with their own allowlist and an unauthorized read stops the run; it is not a gate input, so specification 0.1.3 results are unchanged); deliver the tagged release and reproduction form to at least three outside reviewers; target at least one completed unaffiliated clean-environment reproduction; register for a NIST/CAISI AI Agent Standards Initiative listening session or comment opportunity |
| Prospective ranking-and-recommendation holdout | Q1 2027 | Publish a tagged protocol fixing the generator and seed rule, candidate-set and query construction, partitions, models, NDCG@10 and MRR definitions and denominators, exclusions, thresholds, and analysis code before the holdout is generated; run once; preserve the first pass-or-fail result; any correction gets a new version and a different holdout |
| Incident drills and report | Q2-Q3 2027 | Two artifact-level drills (failed-gate trigger; artifact/hash-mismatch trigger) with detection, decision, reversion, verification, and elapsed time recorded; a drill passes only if the restored hash and rerun gate report match the last accepted release; second technical report; submission to a peer-reviewed venue or workshop on ML reliability or operations, with the acknowledgement retained |
| Adapter contract and additional scenarios | Year 2 (Oct. 2027-Sept. 2028) | Publish the adapter schema and mapping worksheet; implement the adapter contract; add category-aware contextual recommendation (missing context, catalog churn, out-of-stock filtering) and merchant-promotion offer selection (eligibility-rule changes, budget exhaustion) without changing base prices; invite at least one outside team to configure a new scenario under a pre-published protocol; resolve documented outside defects; publish portability notes; submit the AI RMF crosswalk to NIST's resource or comment process where one accepts profile-style contributions |
| Agent-mediated commerce decisions and stabilization | Year 3 (Oct. 2028-Sept. 2029) | Extend the same gates, review routing, and rollback controls to retrieval-augmented and agent-mediated purchasing decisions (an assistant that selects offers or ranks products for a shopper or merchant), the reliability concern NIST's AI Agent Standards Initiative raised in February 2026; stabilize the specification and interface; consolidate reproduction, issue, and limitation history into a practitioner guide; document the maintenance decision |

After the first release: quarterly progress notes; failed and null results retained; dated
outreach, responses, defects, and adaptations logged; reviews published only with the
reviewer's permission. A request is not a review, a review is not use, and interest is not
adoption.

These are targets, not completed activities, except where an item is marked done with its actual completion date and pull request. The current candidate is unreleased; Apache-2.0
remains an intended license pending rights clearance. Development validation and a new
directory on the maintainer's machine do not meet the unaffiliated clean-reproduction
definition. Use [`REPRODUCE.md`](REPRODUCE.md), preserve actual development and publication
dates, and keep completed reports outside the immutable accepted release commit.
