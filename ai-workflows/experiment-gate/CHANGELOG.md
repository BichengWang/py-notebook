## [0.2.0] - Unreleased

### Compatibility and upgrading

Breaking for anything that reads or checks records; no command or option of 0.1.0 was removed.

- **New default record schema.** `experiment-gate`, `expgate.evaluate(summary)` and the GrowthBook importer
  write `schema_version: 3`. Its `input_sha256` is the SHA-256 of the RFC 8785 (JCS) canonical form of
  `input`, not of 0.1.0's python-json-v1 form, so the digest of the same input changes wherever the two
  spell a number differently (for example `20.0`). `produced_by.version` is `0.2.0`.
- **0.1.0 cannot verify schema 3.** A 0.1.0 `experiment-gate-verify` rejects a schema 3 record as
  unsupported. Pin 0.2.0 wherever new records are checked. `evaluate(..., schema_version=2)` still writes the
  0.1.0 form.
- **Old records keep verifying.** `experiment-gate-verify` verifies schema 2 (python-json-v1 digest, 0.1.0
  tail formulas, lenient parsing, unchanged) and schema 3. Schema 1 and any other schema still exit 2. No
  record that verified before stops verifying.
- **Schema 3 numbers.** New records use the accurate tails (`exact_tail=True`): the `srm` scenario records
  `p_value` 6.7e-49 where schema 2 recorded 0.0. Decisions are unchanged; the defaults of
  `stats.sample_ratio_p_value` and `stats.z_for` are unchanged.
- **Stricter schema 3 parsing.** Duplicate keys, non-finite numbers, integers beyond 2^53-1 and lone
  surrogates anywhere in a schema 3 record exit 2 (schema 2 stays lenient).
- **Replay comparison.** Recomputed statistics now agree within a relative 1e-9 (absolute 1e-12 where the
  replayed value is exactly 0) for both schemas, so records written on one platform verify on another. Inputs,
  digests, strings, booleans, dispositions and structure stay exact.
- **Unchanged:** Python 3.11 or later, no runtime dependencies, decision rules, existing options and exit
  codes of `experiment-gate` and `experiment-gate-verify` without the new flags.

### Added
- Decision record **schema 3**, written by default (`expgate/jcs.py`, checked against 647 number, structure
  and rejection vectors).
- JSON Schemas for schema 2 and 3 as package data (`expgate/schema/decision.v2.json`, `decision.v3.json`).
- Conformance vectors under `conformance/`: valid, tampered and invalid records for schemas 2 and 3, a
  schema-1 record, exact canonical input bytes, `manifest.json`, and a deterministic generator
  (`conformance/generate.py [--check]`). CI validates CLI-produced records against the schemas with a pinned
  dev-only `jsonschema`, verifies the vectors with the built wheel, and a separate Node job validates every
  vector and recomputes every digest.
- Signed records (P-012): `experiment-gate keygen KEY` and `--sign-key KEY` on the producer (one
  `decision.json.dsse.json` per record, also for `--all-scenarios`), and `--require-signature` (`--key
  [--signature]`, or `--sigstore-bundle` with `--certificate-identity` and `--certificate-oidc-issuer`) on
  `experiment-gate-verify`. HMAC-SHA256 DSSE envelopes carry an in-toto Statement v1 whose subject is the
  SHA-256 of the exact `decision.json` bytes; the predicate type names the schema version. Sigstore signing
  is external `cosign`; verification delegates to `cosign verify-blob-attestation` on a private copy of the
  bytes already read. `experiment-gate predicate` writes the predicate for `cosign attest-blob`. The file is
  read once: signature, parse and replay see the same bytes. Unsigned, wrong key, edited-and-re-hashed,
  wrong predicate type or malformed envelope fields (null or odd-typed `sig`, `payload`, `predicateType`,
  `subject` or digest) exit 1; a bad key file, missing `cosign` or flag misuse exits 2 (a bad `--sign-key`
  before any output is written). Behavior without the flags is unchanged. CI signs a record keylessly and
  verifies it with the package, and the wheel smoke check round-trips an HMAC signature.
- `experiment-gate --from growthbook results.json --mapping mapping.json` (P-025): converts the body of
  GrowthBook's `GET /api/v1/experiments/{id}/results` (per-variation users, counts, means and standard
  deviations) into an expgate input, evaluates it under expgate's rules and writes a normal schema-3 record.
  Offline and standard library only (`expgate/importers/growthbook.py`). A mapping file supplies what the
  export lacks: metric type, direction and guardrail margin, and a `snapshot` block asserting the snapshot's
  allocation share and that it was not regression-adjusted, because the results endpoint pairs the latest
  snapshot with the experiment's current settings; the assertions are recorded in `source.asserted` and the
  import is refused when the export's current weights or adjustment flags contradict them. A malformed or
  unsupported export or mapping (other dimensions than none, more than two variations or a repeated
  variation id, regression adjustment or sequential testing, a phase that is not a valid index, a
  probability outside [0, 1], a metric whose shape contradicts its type, duplicate keys, `NaN`) exits 2 with
  the field named. Post-stratification is accepted. GrowthBook's p-values, intervals and chance to win are
  never used for the decision. The README has the field mapping and what is and is not imported.
- Optional `source` object in a schema-3 `input` (`format`, `export_sha256`, experiment and snapshot ids,
  `stats_engine`, `asserted`, `reading`) in `decision.v3.json`. `export_sha256` is the SHA-256 of the export
  file's exact bytes, so `input_sha256` covers it and `experiment-gate-verify` detects an edit. `reading`
  holds the importer's reading of GrowthBook's own statistics (ship, hold or rollback) and, when it differs
  from expgate's decision, the `policy difference:` lines that `reasons` then repeats; replay reproduces
  them. Decisions never depend on `source`. Schema 2 rejects it.
- Fixtures captured from a throwaway self-hosted GrowthBook 5.1.0 with a synthetic warehouse
  (`tests/fixtures/growthbook/`: three exports, a mapping file and the dev-only capture script and compose
  stack), and `tests/test_growthbook.py`. One export shows GrowthBook's reading and expgate's decision
  agreeing, one a SHIP reading that expgate holds because a guardrail is not shown non-inferior, one a HOLD
  reading that expgate ships by its one-sided test. They are software-behavior evidence only: the data is
  synthetic.
- Golden vectors under `tests/golden/` that compare every estimator in `expgate.stats` with scipy,
  statsmodels, gbstats and confseq (P-013; dev-only, pinned in `tests/golden/requirements.txt`). The default
  tests read the committed JSON and need no third-party library; a CI job regenerates the vectors and fails
  on any difference. The README documents references, versions, tolerances and the deliberate differences
  (pooled versus unpooled proportion variance, normal versus t critical values, the CUPED slope and
  standard error).
- `exact_tail=True` on `stats.sample_ratio_p_value` and `stats.z_for` (`erfc` and `-inv_cdf(alpha)`). The
  cross-checks showed the defaults lose digits in the tails: the sample-ratio p-value below about 1e-7 and
  as exactly 0.0 past `z` of about 8.3, `z_for` for `alpha` below about 1e-9. The defaults are unchanged:
  schema-2 records, including every 0.1.0 scenario record (now committed as test fixtures), replay with the
  formulas that produced them. Schema 3 uses `exact_tail=True` (one mapping, `records.EXACT_TAIL`).

### Changed
- New records have `schema_version: 3` (see Compatibility and upgrading).
- Replay comparison for schemas 2 and 3 is one function with a relative 1e-9 tolerance on computed
  statistics (see Compatibility and upgrading).
- Schema 3 canonicalizes the whole record when verifying, so ignored members with unsafe integers,
  overflowed floats or lone surrogates exit 2, and `evaluate` raises `ValueError` for a schema-3 input whose
  statistics overflow to infinity.

### Fixed
- `experiment-gate-verify` no longer reports last-digit float differences between platforms: the 0.1.0
  scenario records written on macOS now verify on Linux (five of seven failed before).

### Security
- Signed records (see Added) bind a record to a key: an edited record whose digest was recomputed passes
  the digest check but fails `--require-signature`. HMAC proves possession of the shared key, not an
  individual author; hashes and signatures do not prove the input data is true. See the repository
  `SECURITY.md` for key generation, storage and rotation.
- Schema 3 rejects duplicate keys, non-finite numbers, out-of-range integers and lone surrogates instead of
  silently accepting them.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-13

### Added
- Installable standard-library-only package, MIT license, `experiment-gate` and
  `experiment-gate-verify` commands, `python -m expgate`, and a small public API.
- Schema-2 records with producer version, embedded input and canonical input SHA-256;
  offline verification reports hash and replay mismatches. Schema 1 remains readable
  but cannot be verified without embedded input.
- Ratio, CUPED and sequential examples, wheel smoke checks and replay coverage.

### Changed
- Whole runs publish atomically from an adjacent staging directory, allowing retry
  after a write failure without partial output.
- MDE now states its normal-approximation basis; sequential MDE describes the current
  look and does not promise power under a stopping rule.

### Fixed
- Reject unknown summary/spec keys and undeclared arm metrics instead of ignoring them.
- Treat zero-standard-error primary and guardrail metrics as inconclusive, preventing
  unsupported significance and non-inferiority claims.
