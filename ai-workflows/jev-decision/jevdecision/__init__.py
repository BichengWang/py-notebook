"""jevdecision: Jev as the core decision model, with an OpenAI Decisions API backend.

A decision model answers bounded questions about a state with typed,
probability-bearing answers instead of generated text. This package defines the
questions and answers once and talks to either provider:

    from jevdecision import Choice, DecisionModel, Noul

    model = DecisionModel.from_env()          # DECISION_BACKEND=jev (default) or openai
    decision = model.decide(
        "Help! My payouts have been failing for 3 days.",
        [
            Noul("refund", "Is the customer asking for a refund?"),
            Choice("department", "Which team should handle this?", {
                "billing": "Payments, invoicing, refunds",
                "technical": "Bugs, outages, integrations",
            }),
        ],
    )
    decision["department"].choice
