    Conclusion:
    
    Tax timing dramatically impacts long-term wealth:
    $8 billion
    $455 million
    $13 million
    
    1. **Deferred Tax**: $8.59T final value (85.9B% return)
       - Best strategy: no tax drag during growth
       - Use 401k/IRA accounts for maximum benefit
    
    2. **Long-term Annual Tax**: $455B final value (4.6B% return)  
       - 18.9x better than short-term due to 20% vs 40% tax rate
       - Hold investments >1 year for long-term capital gains
    
    3. **Short-term Annual Tax**: $13.3B final value (133M% return)
       - Worst performance due to 40% tax rate and annual tax drag
       - Avoid frequent trading
    
    **Key Takeaway**: Tax-deferred accounts can outperform annual taxation by 19,000x over 30 years.
