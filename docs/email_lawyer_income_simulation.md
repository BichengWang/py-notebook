Subject: Income Simulation Across Legal Practice Areas – Draft Results and Tooling

Hi [Name],

I put together a small simulation to estimate potential annual net income for solo practitioners across several practice areas (Corporate, Criminal Defense, Family Law, Personal Injury, Immigration, Intellectual Property, Real Estate, and Tax).

What it does:
- Uses simple Monte Carlo draws to model billing models (hourly, flat-fee, contingency), utilization, fees/rates, success rates, settlements, and expenses.
- Produces summary stats (mean, P10, median, P90) for annual net income per practice.
- Parameters are conservative, illustrative defaults and easily adjustable in code.

How to run:
```bash
python /Users/bichengwang/codes/py-notebook/src/lawyer_income_simulation.py --samples 10000 --seed 42
```

Notes on assumptions:
- Hourly models: stochastic hourly rate, utilization, and yearly hour capacity.
- Flat-fee models: stochastic fee per case and cases per year.
- Contingency models: draws for case count, success rates, average settlements, and fee percentage.
- Expenses include fixed and variable components (as a percentage of revenue).

Next steps and options:
- Calibrate parameters with your historical data or market benchmarks.
- Add overhead detail (marketing, staff, insurance, court costs) per domain.
- Model growth (client acquisition, reputation) over multi‑year horizons.
- Export results to CSV or charts for presentations.

If this looks useful, I can fine‑tune the inputs and add a report export. Happy to discuss.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
